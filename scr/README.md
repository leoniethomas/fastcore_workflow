# script for the analysis of bulkRNAseq data 

## To Do: 
- [ ] add the FVA_similarity script from Thomas to the workflow 
- [ ] compare flux sum - what is that ? 
- [ ] check out driverData script -> https://github.com/sysbiolux/AKR1A1-Deficiency/blob/main/scripts/driverData.m
- [ ] fitting curve  function ->  incooperate -> https://github.com/sysbiolux/AKR1A1-Deficiency/blob/main/scripts/fittingcurve_TS.m
- [ ] get gene lengths script -> https://github.com/sysbiolux/AKR1A1-Deficiency/blob/main/scripts/genelength_R.R
- [ ] flux sum script -> metsFluxSumStats.m


## Questions:
- why do we use the flux sum ? 
- signal to noise ratio ? 
- the statistical testing is not in there!
- why do we use signal to noise ?
