# Metabolic network analysis workflow

This repository provides a workflow for the preprocessing as well as the analysis of the context specific metabolic models created by fastcormics. 

There are two main parts of this workflow: 
+ Preprocessing of the transcriptomics data + QC 
+ Analysis of the constructed models, including an approach to quantify the difference between models from different conditions
